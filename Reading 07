## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
My main take away is about working in teams/groups and how group dynamics play a role in the success or failure of the team. How well they work together and what attributes to their success.

* The REST set of constraints will makes your APIs easier to use and also easier to discover for a developer
