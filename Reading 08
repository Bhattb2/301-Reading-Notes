What is SQL?
•	SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. 
•	SQL is used to communicate with a database. 
•	It is the standard language for relational database management systems.
•	SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. 
•	Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. 
•	Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system. 
•	The standard SQL commands such as "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database. 
Table Basics
•	A relational database system contains one or more objects called tables. 
•	The data or information for the database are stored in these tables. 
•	Tables are uniquely identified by their names and are comprised of columns and rows. 
•	Columns contain the column name, data type, and any other attributes for the column.
•	Rows contain the records or data for the columns.
