## jQuery, Events, and The DOM
    1.jQuery makes it straightforward to set up event-driven responses on page elements. These events are often triggered by the end user's interaction with the page, such as when text is entered into a form element or the mouse pointer is moved. In some cases, such as the page load and unload events, the browser itself will trigger the event.
    2. jQuery offers convenience methods for most native browser events. 
    3. These methods — including .click(), .focus(), .blur(), .change(), etc. — are shorthand for jQuery's .on() method. The on method is useful for binding the same handler function to multiple events, when you want to provide data to the event handler, when you are working with custom events, or when you want to pass an object of multiple events and handlers.
    4. jQuery is a powerful and widely used JavaScript library to simplify common web scripting task.
    5. jQuery is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich JavaScript library that is based on the principle "write less, do more". It's easy-to-use APIs makes the things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, adding animation effects to a web page much simpler
