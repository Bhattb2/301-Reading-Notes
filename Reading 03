## Fexbox and Templating
1. JavaScript templates are a method of separating HTML structure from the content contained within. 
2. Templating systems generally introduce some new syntax.
3. Some of the popular templating engines out are: Mustache, Handlebars and jQuery Template.
4. Mustache is a multi-language, logic-less templating system. The mustache.js implementation is just one of many.  
5. Handlebars.js is built on top of Mustache and is mostly compatible with Mustache templates. It provides everything mustache.js provides, plus it supports block expressions and precompiled templates.
